# Movie-Watchlist-App-Simplified-Version

This is a simplified version of the Movie Watchlist App stored in a separate repository.
This app uses a PostgreSQL database to store all information. In this simplified version, 
a user is presented a menu option that allows the user to add a new movie/series to the 
list, view all movies/series stored in the database, watch a movie (which adds the movie
to the watched table), view all movies/series in the watched table, and search for a specific
movie/series using a search term.
